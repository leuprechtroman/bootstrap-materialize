# bootstrap-materialize
This Project aims to do a complete port of Materialize CSS (http://materializecss.com/) to Bootstrap(http://getbootstrap.com/) by using SASS using an open license


## Why another "Material Design meets Bootstrap" Project?
We realized: MaterializeCSS did a great job at porting Material Design to the Web. Bootstrap did a great job of doing responsive Sites. There are already some projects aiming at bringing material design to Bootstrap but they are either licensed restrictively or not at the level we'd expect. So we created this.
